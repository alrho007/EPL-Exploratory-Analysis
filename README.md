# EPL-Exploratory-Analysis
Repo for EPL Exploratory Analysis project

# Introduction
This project describes the performance of active English Premier League players until the end of the 2019/2020 football season.
The dataset was extracted from www.fbref.com and www.premierleague.com to used to confirm the veracity of the statistics.
The data was then imported into Microsoft Excel and SQL for data wrangling(correcting inconsistent data types, filling missing values etc) and the refined
data was passed into Power BI to make visualizations for exploratory analysis. The data was separated into four different positions; goalkeepers, defenders,
midfielders and attackers to be able to notice correlations among statistics peculiar to each position.

# Insights
